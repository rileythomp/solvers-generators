# Solvers and Generators

This site is the front-end for a number of different solver and generator animations such as mazes, Sudoku and Truchet tiles. The 5 sudoku solvers had over 15,000 boards solved to compare speed, and more than 100,000 mazes were generated for feature comparison. Code for the sudoku solvers is [here](https://github.com/rileythomp/sudoku) and maze generators [here](https://github.com/rileythomp/mazes).
